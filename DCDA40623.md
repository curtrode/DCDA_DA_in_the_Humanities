# Course Description

## Catalog Description

Students will develop the skills to transform humanities research
questions into data-driven arguments and compelling visualizations.
Building on prior coursework in coding and statistics, this course
emphasizes interpretation over implementation: learning to ask better
questions, make defensible analytical choices, and communicate findings
to diverse audiences.

## Prerequisites & Concurrent Enrollment

ADRN 20623 or DCDA 20833 or WRIT 20833 or COSC 10603 or GEOG 30323; and
MATH 10043 or INSC 20153.

## Program & Major Connections

This course serves as the Data Analytics Elective or a General Elective
for the DCDA major, and as an Elective for the DCDA minor.

# Course Materials

## Required Materials

A free GitHub Education (Student Developer) account

A paid tier subscription to a trusted AI service is strongly
recommended.

## Supplementary Resources

To be provided throughout the semester to respond to students' immediate
needs.

# Teaching Philosophy & Methodology

The course is grounded in a conviction that distinguishes humanistic
data analysis from its counterparts in business or the social sciences:
that data should be used to test beliefs rather than defend them. This
epistemological commitment shapes everything from the questions students
learn to ask ("What would change my mind?") to the visualizations they
learn to build (displays that show reasoning, not just conclusions). In
an era when data visualizations circulate widely and often function as
instruments of persuasion rather than inquiry, this critical orientation
is both intellectually necessary and professionally valuable.

# Learning Outcomes

## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Formulate research questions that data can meaningfully address,
    identifying what evidence would be required to test or revise a
    belief.

2.  Make and justify decisions about what to count, categorize, or
    exclude, articulating the interpretive consequences of these
    choices.

3.  Clean and transform data for analysis, documenting preparation
    decisions and their rationale.

4.  Choose appropriate visualization types for different analytical
    purposes, matching form to argument.

5.  Construct visual arguments for specific audiences, designing
    displays that invite inquiry rather than foreclose it.

6.  Critique data presentations---their own and others'---for rhetorical
    and evidentiary integrity, recognizing when visualizations obscure
    uncertainty or defend conclusions rather than test them.

7.  Document and communicate methodological choices, producing
    reflective accounts that make analytical reasoning visible.

## Program & Major Learning Outcomes

These outcomes are particular to the major/minors in Digital Culture and
Data Analytics (DCDA):

- Students will demonstrate an ability to compose digital arguments.
  [DCO01]
- Students will develop at least basic proficiency with at least one
  coding language. [DAO01]

## TCU Outcomes: Core Curriculum & Finding Ourselves in Community

The course will be vetted for core credit after officially approved.

# Course Requirements

## Assignments

### Formal Writing & Research

**Cover Memos** Students will write Cover Memos (300-500 words) for each
major project (module), articulating their conceptual goals and
technical execution.

**Reflections**

- **Baseline Reflection:** Students articulate their incoming skills,
  assumptions, and goals for the course.

- **Midterm Reflection with Proposed Grade:** Students assess their
  learning so far, citing specific evidence from their work, and propose
  a grade with justification.

- **Final Reflection with Proposed Grade:** Students make an
  evidence-based argument for their course grade, drawing on all work
  produced and growth demonstrated.

### Labs, Presentations & Critiques

**Module 1: Textual Data and Frequency Visualization**

- **Lab 1a: Building and Exploring a Text Corpus:** Hands-on work
  acquiring, cleaning, and performing initial exploration of textual
  data.

- **Lab 1b: Visualizing Textual Patterns:** Creating frequency-based
  visualizations and interpreting what they reveal and obscure.

- **Module 1 Deliverable: Textual Analysis:** A visualization of textual
  data accompanied by a brief interpretive statement addressing choices
  made and limitations encountered.

**Module 2: Tabular Data and Comparative Visualization**

- **Lab 2a: Cleaning and Structuring Historical Data:** Working with
  tabular historical records; addressing missing data, inconsistent
  categories, and documentation.

- **Lab 2b: Comparative Visualizations:** Building visualizations that
  compare across time periods or groups; small multiples, grouped
  charts, time series.

- **Module 2 Deliverable: Comparative Analysis:** A comparative
  visualization with written reflection on categorization decisions and
  their interpretive consequences.

**Module 3: Spatial Data and Geographic Visualization**

- **Lab 3a: From Coordinates to Questions:** Geocoding, joining spatial
  data, and formulating place-based research questions.

- **Lab 3b: Geographic Visualization:** Creating maps that argue rather
  than merely display; choropleth, point density, and layered
  approaches.

- **Module 3 Deliverable: Spatial Argument:** A map-based visualization
  with accompanying text explaining how spatial representation shapes
  interpretation.

**Module 4: Relational Data and Network Visualization**

- **Lab 4a: Building and Querying Networks:** Constructing network data
  from humanities sources; nodes, edges, and attributes.

- **Lab 4b: Interactive Visualization:** Building visualizations that
  invite exploration; interactivity as a form of argument.

- **Module 4 Deliverable: Relational Analysis:** A network or
  interactive visualization with reflection on what relational structure
  reveals.

### Final Evaluative Exercise

**Independent Project**

- **Independent Project Proposal:** A brief document identifying the
  research question, data source(s), intended audience, and preliminary
  approach.

- **Final Project: Functional Component:** A polished visualization or
  interactive piece designed for a specific audience, suitable for
  public presentation or portfolio.

- **Final Project: Reflective Documentation:** A methodological
  narrative documenting choices, dead ends, revisions, and what the data
  can and cannot support.

## Grading Philosophy & Policy

This course utilizes an Ungrading philosophy. This means I will not
assign letter grades to individual assignments. Instead, we will focus
on qualitative feedback, self-reflection, and iterative improvement.

- **Feedback:** You will receive detailed feedback on your code and
  concepts.
- **Self-Evaluation:** You will regularly reflect on your own learning
  and progress through the course of the semester (see Self-Reflection
  above)
- **Final Grade:** At the end of the semester, you will submit a
  portfolio and a self-evaluation proposing your final grade based on
  your growth, effort, and the quality of your work. If my assessment
  differs significantly from yours, we will meet to discuss it.

**Why Ungrading?** Creative coding requires risk-taking and failure. A
traditional grading system often punishes failure, leading to safe,
boring work. Ungrading encourages you to experiment, break things, and
learn from the process without fear of a low grade.

### Late Work

Our schedule is tight, and you have important work to do. In the context
of our Ungrading policy, I see assignment deadlines as milestones to
keep you on track for the course's 4 projects.

"Failure" to submit your work in a timely fashion will affect our
ability to provide timely and needed feedback on your work and could
affect the persuasiveness of the arguments you make for your midterm and
semester grades.

### Participation, Engagement & Attendance

Coding is a practice, not just a theory. Attendance in studio sessions
is critical for debugging and peer learning. If you miss class, the
instructor will not catch you up during class time, as this will slow
down the progress of other students. If you need assistance making up
missed work, please make an appointment before the next class period
meets: https://calendly.com/c-rode/appointments
