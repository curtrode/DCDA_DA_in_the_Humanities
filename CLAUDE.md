# Project Rules

## No Assumptions
- Do not assume what the user wants. If something is ambiguous, ask for clarification.
- Do not infer requirements that were not explicitly stated.
- Do not guess file names, paths, or content when uncertain.

## No Unauthorized Changes
- Do not write or edit code without explicit permission from the user.
- Do not create, modify, or delete files unless specifically instructed to do so.
- Always confirm the intended action before making changes to any files.

## Ask Questions
- If instructions are unclear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
- When multiple interpretations of a request are possible, present options and ask which is preferred.
- It is better to ask too many questions than to make incorrect assumptions.

## Student Evaluation
- Instructors use ungrading system. Never assignment points or weigihts on assignments.
