# Course Description

## Catalog Description

Students will develop the skills to read, interpret, and critically
evaluate data visualizations encountered in journalism, research, and
public discourse. Through hands-on work with spreadsheets, visualization
tools, and introductory coding, students learn to ask what data can and
cannot show, how design choices shape interpretation, and what
responsibilities accompany the display of evidence. No prior experience
with coding or statistics is required.

## Prerequisites & Concurrent Enrollment

None.

## Program & Major Connections

This course serves as the Intro Requirement for the DCDA major.

# Course Materials

## Required Materials

A laptop with Microsoft Excel (available through TCU's Microsoft 365
license)

Free accounts for web-based visualization tools (Datawrapper, RAWGraphs)
will be set up in class

## Supplementary Resources

To be provided throughout the semester to respond to students' immediate
needs.

# Teaching Philosophy & Methodology

The course is grounded in a conviction that distinguishes humanistic
data analysis from its counterparts in business or the social sciences:
that data should be used to test beliefs rather than defend them. This
epistemological commitment shapes everything from the questions students
learn to ask ("What would change my mind?") to the visualizations they
learn to read and build (displays that show reasoning, not just
conclusions). In an era when data visualizations circulate widely and
often function as instruments of persuasion rather than inquiry, this
critical orientation is both intellectually necessary and professionally
valuable.

# Learning Outcomes

## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Identify and articulate the claims---explicit and implicit---that a
    data visualization makes, distinguishing between what the data shows
    and what the display suggests.

2.  Evaluate the choices embedded in a visualization (what to count,
    what to exclude, how to categorize, how to display), recognizing
    that these are interpretive decisions with consequences.

3.  Construct basic data visualizations using spreadsheets and GUI-based
    tools, making deliberate choices about form, scale, and emphasis.

4.  Analyze historical and contemporary examples of data visualization
    as acts of argument, identifying the rhetorical strategies at work.

5.  Identify what is absent or obscured in a data presentation,
    articulating the limits of what a given dataset or display can
    support.

6.  Design a visualization for a specific audience, explaining how
    audience and purpose shape presentational choices.

7.  Reflect on their own analytical development, making evidence-based
    arguments about their learning.

## Program & Major Learning Outcomes

These outcomes are particular to the major/minors in Digital Culture and
Data Analytics (DCDA):

- Students will demonstrate an ability to compose digital arguments.

## TCU Outcomes: Core Curriculum & Finding Ourselves in Community

The course will be vetted for core credit after officially approved.

# Course Requirements

## Assignments

### Formal Writing & Research

**Reflections**

- **Baseline Reflection:** Students articulate their incoming
  relationship to data and visualization---what they notice, what they
  trust, and what they find confusing.

- **Midterm Reflection with Proposed Grade:** Students assess their
  learning so far, citing specific evidence from their work, and propose
  a grade with justification.

- **Final Reflection with Proposed Grade:** Students make an
  evidence-based argument for their course grade, drawing on all work
  produced and growth demonstrated.

### Labs & Module Deliverables

**Module 1: What Counts as Data?**

- **Lab 1a: From Observation to Spreadsheet:** Hands-on practice turning
  qualitative observations into structured data in Excel; confronting
  decisions about what to count and how to categorize.

- **Lab 1b: Your First Chart:** Building basic charts in Excel;
  exploring how different chart types tell different stories from the
  same data.

- **Module 1 Deliverable:** A visualization built in Excel from a
  dataset the student assembled, accompanied by a brief statement about
  what they chose to count and why.

**Module 1H: Seeing Data---A Short History of Visualization**

- **Lab 1Ha: Reading Historical Visualizations:** Close analysis of
  landmark visualizations (Nightingale's rose diagram, Snow's cholera
  map, Du Bois's data portraits, Minard's Napoleon chart) as objects of
  interpretation, not just illustration.

- **Lab 1Hb: What Were They Arguing?:** Students select one historical
  visualization and write a brief analysis identifying the argument, the
  audience, and the choices that shaped the display.

- **Module 1H Deliverable:** A written analysis of a historical
  visualization identifying what it argues, how its design shapes that
  argument, and what it leaves out.

**Module 2: What Does This Chart Actually Say?**

- **Lab 2a: Chart Anatomy and Rhetoric:** Deconstructing published
  visualizations---axis choices, color, scale, framing---to identify how
  design shapes meaning.

- **Lab 2b: Same Data, Different Story:** Using a GUI tool (Datawrapper
  or RAWGraphs), students produce two different visualizations from the
  same dataset and write about how each version argues differently.

- **Module 2 Deliverable:** Two visualizations of the same data built
  with a GUI tool, accompanied by a comparative analysis of how each
  display shapes interpretation.

**Module 3: What's Missing?**

- **Lab 3a: Gaps, Absences, and Limits:** Working with a dataset that
  has missing values, inconsistent categories, or excluded populations;
  exploring what can and cannot be shown.

- **Lab 3b: Making Absence Visible:** Building a visualization that
  acknowledges or foregrounds what is missing rather than hiding it;
  introduction to pre-built notebooks.

- **Module 3 Deliverable:** A visualization that makes absence or
  limitation visible, with a reflection on what the data cannot support.

**Module 4: Who Is This For?**

- **Lab 4a: Audience, Purpose, and Ethics:** Examining how the same data
  is presented differently for different audiences (academic paper vs.
  news graphic vs. advocacy piece); ethical dimensions of display.

- **Lab 4b: Building for an Audience:** Using a pre-built notebook,
  students modify and customize a visualization for a specific audience,
  making deliberate choices about what to show, emphasize, and explain.

- **Module 4 Deliverable:** A visualization designed for a specific
  audience using a pre-built notebook, accompanied by a brief audience
  analysis explaining how audience and purpose shaped design choices.

### Final Evaluative Exercise

**Data Story**

- **Data Story Proposal:** A brief document identifying a question, a
  dataset, an intended audience, and a preliminary approach.

- **Data Story: Visual Component:** A set of 2-3 connected
  visualizations that build a coherent argument, using any tools from the
  course.

- **Data Story: Narrative Component:** A written narrative (800-1200
  words) that connects the visualizations, explains the choices made, and
  articulates what the data can and cannot support.

## Grading Philosophy & Policy

This course utilizes an Ungrading philosophy. This means I will not
assign letter grades to individual assignments. Instead, we will focus
on qualitative feedback, self-reflection, and iterative improvement.

- **Feedback:** You will receive detailed feedback on your work and
  concepts.
- **Self-Evaluation:** You will regularly reflect on your own learning
  and progress through the course of the semester (see Self-Reflection
  above)
- **Final Grade:** At the end of the semester, you will submit a
  portfolio and a self-evaluation proposing your final grade based on
  your growth, effort, and the quality of your work. If my assessment
  differs significantly from yours, we will meet to discuss it.

**Why Ungrading?** Critical inquiry requires risk-taking and failure. A
traditional grading system often punishes failure, leading to safe,
boring work. Ungrading encourages you to experiment, try new things, and
learn from the process without fear of a low grade.

### Late Work

Our schedule is tight, and you have important work to do. In the context
of our Ungrading policy, I see assignment deadlines as milestones to
keep you on track for the course's 5 modules and final project.

"Failure" to submit your work in a timely fashion will affect our
ability to provide timely and needed feedback on your work and could
affect the persuasiveness of the arguments you make for your midterm and
semester grades.

### Participation, Engagement & Attendance

Working with data is a practice, not just a theory. Attendance in
workshop sessions is critical for hands-on learning and peer
collaboration. If you miss class, the instructor will not catch you up
during class time, as this will slow down the progress of other
students. If you need assistance making up missed work, please make an
appointment before the next class period meets:
