Data Analysis and Visualization in the Humanities

*Course Planning Document*

Course Rationale

*For curriculum committee review*

This course addresses a critical gap in the Digital Culture and Data Analytics curriculum: the need for a methods course that bridges foundational technical skills and advanced application. Students entering the course will have completed introductory coursework in both statistics and programming (Python or R), giving them the technical vocabulary to work with data. What they lack is sustained practice in the interpretive and rhetorical dimensions of data work---the capacity to move from pattern recognition to meaningful argument.

The course is grounded in a conviction that distinguishes humanistic data analysis from its counterparts in business or the social sciences: that data should be used to test beliefs rather than defend them. This epistemological commitment shapes everything from the questions students learn to ask (\"What would change my mind?\") to the visualizations they learn to build (displays that show reasoning, not just conclusions). In an era when data visualizations circulate widely and often function as instruments of persuasion rather than inquiry, this critical orientation is both intellectually necessary and professionally valuable.

The course structure moves students from tightly scaffolded modules---where they work with shared datasets and develop common analytical vocabulary---toward increasing independence, culminating in a self-directed final project. This arc prepares students for the capstone course while also producing portfolio-ready work. The four modules expose students to different data types (textual, tabular/historical, spatial, and relational) and different visualization approaches, ensuring breadth while the final project allows depth.

Assessment follows an ungrading model in which students produce three reflections across the semester---baseline, midterm, and final---each requiring them to make evidence-based arguments about their own learning. This approach mirrors the course\'s intellectual commitments: just as students learn to hold their analytical claims accountable to evidence, they learn to hold their self-assessments accountable to the work they have produced.

The course is designed to be taught by rotating instructors with varied disciplinary backgrounds. Learning outcomes remain consistent, while specific datasets, examples, and disciplinary emphases can adapt to instructor expertise and student interests.

Catalog Description

*For student-facing materials*

Students will develop the skills to transform humanities research questions into data-driven arguments and compelling visualizations. Building on prior coursework in coding and statistics, this course emphasizes interpretation over implementation: learning to ask better questions, make defensible analytical choices, and communicate findings to diverse audiences. Through four modules covering textual, tabular, spatial, and relational data, students will practice the full cycle of humanistic data work---from formulating questions and preparing data to building visualizations that show reasoning rather than merely display conclusions. The course culminates in an independent project that produces both a functional, portfolio-ready visualization and reflective documentation of the methodological choices behind it. Prerequisite: WRIT 20833 or COSC 10603 or GEOG 30323; and MATH 10043 or INSC 20153.

Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Formulate research questions that data can meaningfully address, identifying what evidence would be required to test or revise a belief.

2.  Make and justify decisions about what to count, categorize, or exclude, articulating the interpretive consequences of these choices.

3.  Clean and transform data for analysis, documenting preparation decisions and their rationale.

4.  Choose appropriate visualization types for different analytical purposes, matching form to argument.

5.  Construct visual arguments for specific audiences, designing displays that invite inquiry rather than foreclose it.

6.  Critique data presentations---their own and others\'---for rhetorical and evidentiary integrity, recognizing when visualizations obscure uncertainty or defend conclusions rather than test them.

7.  Document and communicate methodological choices, producing reflective accounts that make analytical reasoning visible.

Module 2: Tabular Data and Comparative Visualization

- **Lab 2a: Cleaning and Structuring Historical Data:** Working with tabular historical records; addressing missing data, inconsistent categories, and documentation.

- **Lab 2b: Comparative Visualizations:** Building visualizations that compare across time periods or groups; small multiples, grouped charts, time series.

- **Module 2 Deliverable: Comparative Analysis:** A comparative visualization with written reflection on categorization decisions and their interpretive consequences.

Module 3: Spatial Data and Geographic Visualization

- **Lab 3a: From Coordinates to Questions:** Geocoding, joining spatial data, and formulating place-based research questions.

- **Lab 3b: Geographic Visualization:** Creating maps that argue rather than merely display; choropleth, point density, and layered approaches.

- **Module 3 Deliverable: Spatial Argument:** A map-based visualization with accompanying text explaining how spatial representation shapes interpretation.

Module 4: Relational Data and Network Visualization

- **Lab 4a: Building and Querying Networks:** Constructing network data from humanities sources; nodes, edges, and attributes.

- **Lab 4b: Interactive Visualization:** Building visualizations that invite exploration; interactivity as a form of argument.

- **Module 4 Deliverable: Relational Analysis:** A network or interactive visualization with reflection on what relational structure reveals.

Independent Project

- **Independent Project Proposal:** A brief document identifying the research question, data source(s), intended audience, and preliminary approach.

- **Final Project: Functional Component:** A polished visualization or interactive piece designed for a specific audience, suitable for public presentation or portfolio.

- **Final Project: Reflective Documentation:** A methodological narrative documenting choices, dead ends, revisions, and what the data can and cannot support.

Notes for Instructors

- **Datasets and examples are flexible.** The modules are organized by data type, but the specific corpora, archives, or sources used can and should reflect instructor expertise and student interests.

- **Readings are purposeful and brief.** Each reading should directly serve the work students are doing that week. Methodological how-tos, critical provocations, exemplary projects, and foundational texts on evidence and display all have a place.

- **Workshop time increases across the semester.** Early sessions include more structured discussion; later sessions shift toward intensive lab and workshop formats as students develop independence.

- **The epistemological thread is explicit.** Recurring attention to how we know what we claim to know---and what we owe others when we make claims---distinguishes this course from purely technical methods training.

- **Ungrading mirrors course content.** The reflection structure asks students to make evidence-based arguments about their own learning, enacting the same epistemological commitments they are learning to apply to data.
