Data Viz for Humans, ADRN 20623

*Course Planning Document*

Course Rationale

*For curriculum committee review*

This course addresses the need for an accessible entry point into data visualization for humanities students who may have no prior experience with coding, statistics, or data analysis. Many students encounter data visualizations daily---in journalism, social media, public policy debates, and academic research---but lack the vocabulary and critical framework to evaluate what these displays actually claim, what they obscure, and how their design shapes interpretation.

The course is organized not around data types or technical skills but around epistemological questions: What counts as data? What does a chart actually say? What is missing? Who is this for? This question-driven structure ensures that students develop critical literacy before---and alongside---technical fluency. The progression from familiar tools (spreadsheets) through GUI-based visualization platforms to lightly scaffolded code prepares students for more advanced coursework while keeping the intellectual questions at the center.

The course shares an epistemological commitment with its upper-level counterpart (DCDA 40623): that data should be used to test beliefs rather than defend them. At the introductory level, this manifests as critical reading---learning to ask "What would change my mind about what this chart is telling me?" At the upper level, it manifests as critical production---building visualizations that show reasoning, not just conclusions. Together, the two courses form a sequence that moves students from informed consumers to reflective producers of data-driven arguments.

A dedicated early module on the history of data visualization (Nightingale, Snow, Du Bois, Minard) provides students with a shared reference vocabulary and demonstrates that visualization has always been an act of interpretation and persuasion, not merely a technical exercise.

Assessment follows an ungrading model consistent with the upper-level course. Students produce reflections across the semester, making evidence-based arguments about their own learning---enacting the same epistemological commitments they are learning to apply to data.

The course is designed to be taught by rotating instructors with varied disciplinary backgrounds. Learning outcomes remain consistent, while specific datasets, examples, and disciplinary emphases can adapt to instructor expertise and student interests.

Catalog Description

*For student-facing materials*

Students will develop the skills to read, interpret, and critically evaluate data visualizations encountered in journalism, research, and public discourse. Through hands-on work with spreadsheets, visualization tools, and introductory coding, students learn to ask what data can and cannot show, how design choices shape interpretation, and what responsibilities accompany the display of evidence. No prior experience with coding or statistics is required. Prerequisite: None. ADRN 20623.

Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Identify and articulate the claims---explicit and implicit---that a data visualization makes, distinguishing between what the data shows and what the display suggests.

2.  Evaluate the choices embedded in a visualization (what to count, what to exclude, how to categorize, how to display), recognizing that these are interpretive decisions with consequences.

3.  Construct basic data visualizations using spreadsheets and GUI-based tools, making deliberate choices about form, scale, and emphasis.

4.  Analyze historical and contemporary examples of data visualization as acts of argument, identifying the rhetorical strategies at work.

5.  Identify what is absent or obscured in a data presentation, articulating the limits of what a given dataset or display can support.

6.  Design a visualization for a specific audience, explaining how audience and purpose shape presentational choices.

7.  Reflect on their own analytical development, making evidence-based arguments about their learning.

Assignments and Projects

Reflections

- **Baseline Reflection:** Students articulate their incoming relationship to data and visualization---what they notice, what they trust, and what they find confusing.

- **Midterm Reflection with Proposed Grade:** Students assess their learning so far, citing specific evidence from their work, and propose a grade with justification.

- **Final Reflection with Proposed Grade:** Students make an evidence-based argument for their course grade, drawing on all work produced and growth demonstrated.

Module 1: What Counts as Data?

- **Lab 1a: From Observation to Spreadsheet:** Hands-on practice turning qualitative observations into structured data in Excel; confronting decisions about what to count and how to categorize.

- **Lab 1b: Your First Chart:** Building basic charts in Excel; exploring how different chart types tell different stories from the same data.

- **Module 1 Deliverable:** A visualization built in Excel from a dataset the student assembled, accompanied by a brief statement about what they chose to count and why.

Module 1H: Seeing Data---A Short History of Visualization

- **Lab 1Ha: Reading Historical Visualizations:** Close analysis of landmark visualizations (Nightingale's rose diagram, Snow's cholera map, Du Bois's data portraits, Minard's Napoleon chart) as objects of interpretation, not just illustration.

- **Lab 1Hb: What Were They Arguing?:** Students select one historical visualization and write a brief analysis identifying the argument, the audience, and the choices that shaped the display.

- **Module 1H Deliverable:** A written analysis of a historical visualization identifying what it argues, how its design shapes that argument, and what it leaves out.

Module 2: What Does This Chart Actually Say?

- **Lab 2a: Chart Anatomy and Rhetoric:** Deconstructing published visualizations---axis choices, color, scale, framing---to identify how design shapes meaning.

- **Lab 2b: Same Data, Different Story:** Using a GUI tool (Datawrapper or RAWGraphs), students produce two different visualizations from the same dataset and write about how each version argues differently.

- **Module 2 Deliverable:** Two visualizations of the same data built with a GUI tool, accompanied by a comparative analysis of how each display shapes interpretation.

Module 3: What's Missing?

- **Lab 3a: Gaps, Absences, and Limits:** Working with a dataset that has missing values, inconsistent categories, or excluded populations; exploring what can and cannot be shown.

- **Lab 3b: Making Absence Visible:** Building a visualization that acknowledges or foregrounds what is missing rather than hiding it; introduction to pre-built notebooks.

- **Module 3 Deliverable:** A visualization that makes absence or limitation visible, with a reflection on what the data cannot support.

Module 4: Who Is This For?

- **Lab 4a: Audience, Purpose, and Ethics:** Examining how the same data is presented differently for different audiences (academic paper vs. news graphic vs. advocacy piece); ethical dimensions of display.

- **Lab 4b: Building for an Audience:** Using a pre-built notebook, students modify and customize a visualization for a specific audience, making deliberate choices about what to show, emphasize, and explain.

- **Module 4 Deliverable:** A visualization designed for a specific audience using a pre-built notebook, accompanied by a brief audience analysis explaining how audience and purpose shaped design choices.

Final Project: Data Story

- **Data Story Proposal:** A brief document identifying a question, a dataset, an intended audience, and a preliminary approach.

- **Data Story: Visual Component:** A set of 2-3 connected visualizations that build a coherent argument, using any tools from the course.

- **Data Story: Narrative Component:** A written narrative (800-1200 words) that connects the visualizations, explains the choices made, and articulates what the data can and cannot support.

Notes for Instructors

- **The question-based structure is deliberate.** Organizing by epistemological questions rather than data types distinguishes this course from the upper-level course (which is organized by data type) and ensures students develop critical vocabulary before encountering technical complexity.

- **History of visualization is a module, not a sidebar.** Dedicating two weeks to historical examples gives students a shared reference vocabulary and establishes from the start that visualization is always an act of argument.

- **The tool progression matters.** Excel first (familiar, low barrier), then GUI tools (Datawrapper, RAWGraphs---no code required), then pre-built notebooks (students modify parameters, not write from scratch). This builds toward the upper-level course without making the intro course feel like a coding boot camp.

- **Datasets and examples are flexible.** The modules are organized by questions, but the specific data used can and should reflect instructor expertise and student interests.

- **Making is central at every level.** Every module includes a produced deliverable, not just written analysis. Students build things from Week 2 onward, even when the tools are simple.

- **The Data Story is scaffolded, not open-ended.** Unlike the upper-level independent project (6 weeks, self-directed), the Data Story has a shorter runway (~3 weeks) and more structured checkpoints. The emphasis is on connecting visualizations through narrative argument.

- **Ungrading mirrors course content.** The reflection structure asks students to make evidence-based arguments about their own learning, enacting the same epistemological commitments they are learning to apply to data.

- **This course feeds the upper-level course.** Students completing this course should arrive at DCDA 40623 able to read visualizations critically, articulate what design choices do, and run a pre-built notebook. The upper course can then focus on production with code, not on building critical vocabulary from scratch.
