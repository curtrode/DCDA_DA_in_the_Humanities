# DCDA 40623: Data Visualization in the Humanities

**Spring 2026 | Texas Christian University**

This repository contains course materials for DCDA 40623, a methods course in the Digital Culture and Data Analytics program that bridges foundational technical skills and advanced application in humanistic data analysis.

## Course Overview

Students develop skills to transform humanities research questions into data-driven arguments and compelling visualizations. The course emphasizes interpretation over implementation: learning to ask better questions, make defensible analytical choices, and communicate findings to diverse audiences.

## Course Structure

The course moves through four modules, each focusing on a different data type:

1. **Textual Data** - Frequency visualization and text corpus analysis
2. **Tabular Data** - Comparative visualization with historical records
3. **Spatial Data** - Geographic visualization and place-based arguments
4. **Relational Data** - Network visualization and interactive displays

The semester culminates in an independent project where students apply these methods to a research question of their choosing.
