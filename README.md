# Data Visualization in the Humanities

**Texas Christian University | Digital Culture and Data Analytics**

This repository contains course materials for a two-course sequence in data visualization within the DCDA program.

## Courses

### ADRN 20623: Data Viz for Humans

An accessible introduction to reading, interpreting, and critically evaluating data visualizations. Organized around epistemological questions (What counts as data? What does this chart actually say? What's missing? Who is this for?), the course progresses from spreadsheets through GUI tools to pre-built notebooks. No prior experience with coding or statistics required.

### DCDA 40623: Data Visualization in the Humanities

An upper-level methods course that bridges foundational technical skills and advanced application in humanistic data analysis. Organized by data type (textual, tabular, spatial, relational), students develop skills to transform humanities research questions into data-driven arguments and compelling visualizations. Prerequisites: ADRN 20623 or DCDA 20833 or WRIT 20833 or COSC 10603 or GEOG 30323; and MATH 10043 or INSC 20153.

## Course Sequence

ADRN 20623 feeds DCDA 40623. Students completing the intro course arrive at the upper level able to read visualizations critically, articulate what design choices do, and run a pre-built notebook. The upper course then focuses on production with code.

## Next Steps

### ADRN 20623
- Determine semester, section number, class location, and meeting times
- Generate HTML version of syllabus (matching DCDA 40623 styling)
- Develop pre-built notebooks for Modules 3 and 4
- Select specific datasets for each module
- Curriculum committee review of planning document

### DCDA 40623
- Fill in important dates (MLK Day, Spring Break, withdrawal deadline, last day, final)
- Add D3/Observable exposure to Module 4 lab materials
- Develop lab notebooks and assignment scaffolding

### Both Courses
- Build shared reference materials for history of visualization module (Nightingale, Snow, Du Bois, Minard)
- Align ungrading reflection prompts across the sequence
- Develop instructor guide for rotating instructors (ADRN 20623)
